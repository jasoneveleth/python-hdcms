# hdcms

This is a wrapper for the `hdcms` C source. It has a similar
interface.

# Examples

```python
import hdcms
c9 = hdcms.filenames_to_stats_1d("data/CM1_9_1.txt,data/CM1_9_2.txt,data/CM1_9_3.txt")
c10 = hdcms.filenames_to_stats_1d("data/CM1_10_1.txt,data/CM1_10_2.txt,data/CM1_10_3.txt")
c3 = hdcms.filenames_to_stats_1d("data/CM1_3_1.txt,data/CM1_3_2.txt,data/CM1_3_3.txt")
print(hdcms.compare_compound_1d(c10, c8), "\n")
print(hdcms.compare_all_1d([c10,c8,c9]))
```

You can also use the 2d functions by changing the `_1d` suffix to
`_2d`.


# Extending

If you extend this code, think carefully about who has owner ship
over the data in a vector/matrix and the numpy reference count. The only way
this would be tricky is if a matrix struct exists in two functions, and you
can't tell one of the function's matrix that it doesn't own the data anymore,
and you give the data to a NUMPY function and it get garbage
collected and frees its data (now the matrix struct thinks it has
valid data when it doesn't). I'm pretty sure I don't make this
mistake, but it would be easy to make in the future. The fix is
just to copy the data (which will make it slightly inefficient,
but that's okay).
